## Inspiration
Healthcare accessibility remains a significant challenge worldwide, especially in remote and underserved areas. The long wait times, lack of language support, and inability to monitor health effectively inspired us to create **Prime Medic AI**. Our goal is to use technology to bridge the gap between individuals and quality healthcare services, empowering users to take control of their health from the comfort of their homes.

## What it does
User's can show their health problems & diseases and injuries to AI Cam, that helps with the diagnosis by giving First-Aid tips, precautions, analysis about problem, food habit, medicines required, doctor to consult etc.
